The rapid development of the campus network construction today, most schools set up FTP servers to provide a lot of digital resources for the teachers and students, but it often cost a lot of time to find the specified resource from a large number of digital resources. Therefore I design a high performance FTP searching engine to help users more quickly and more convenient get the required digital resources is necessary, and it have a positive significance to save costs of query , improve work efficiency .

This paper discusses on the development background and current research status of FTP searching engine, and introduces related technology of system implementation, and does some research on fuzzy search and correlation ranking And describe the development process and method of FTP searching engine in detail. First, the paper analysis the function demands and performance demands of the FTP searching engine. And then based on the needs analysis, design a FTP searching engine based on B/S structure, which offers a variety of inquiry mode, fast response and fuzzy search.
